# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

This is a simple Java program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input. The user enters their weight in kilograms and their height in meters, and the program calculates the BMI and gives an evaluation based on the BMI value.

## How to Use

1. **Input Weight:**  
   The user is prompted to enter their weight in kilograms.

2. **Input Height:**  
   The user is prompted to enter their height in meters.

3. **BMI Calculation:**  
   The BMI is calculated using the formula:
# BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))


4. **BMI Evaluation:**  
The program evaluates the BMI and prints a corresponding message:
- **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5
- **Normal weight:** 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
- **Overweight:** 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
- **Obese:** BMI ≥ 30

## Example
````
Please enter your weight in kilograms: 70 
Please enter your height in meters: 1.75 
Your Body Mass Index = 22.857142857142858
According to the BMI evaluation, you are of normal weight.
